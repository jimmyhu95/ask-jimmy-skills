# Executing Plans

## 本机组装契约

- 这是**备用**执行器，不是默认路径。
- 默认：主 agent `writing-plans` → **一个子 agent** 按计划实现。
- 仅在这些情况改用本技能：子 agent 跑偏、共享协议很脆必须主 agent 连续改、用户明确要求主 agent 自己执行。
- 不要与 `subagent-driven-development` 串联。
- 不要一次执行全部 tickets。

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute all tasks, report when complete.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Ensure an isolated workspace: use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create one or verify the existing one
2. Read plan file
3. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
4. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
5. If no concerns: Create todos for the plan items and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Tasks

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent
